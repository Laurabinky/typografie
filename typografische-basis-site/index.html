<h1>My typographic research</h1>

<p>The first paragraph. You know, the introduction. Let’s add something useful: Don’t look at <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> as <em>semantics</em>, look at <abbr>HTML</abbr> as an important part of your <abbr title="User eXperience">UX</abbr>. What a specific element <em>means</em> is not important, what it <em>does</em> is what counts. Let’s take a look at <em>the link</em> for instance: you can click on a <a href="#target1">link</a>, you can tab to it and then hit the enter key, it can show you if it’s visited, if you <em>right-click</em> or <kbd>command</kbd> + click on it <em>relevant</em> actions are shown, it gets read out as a link to people who use screen readers, and more. If you style a <code>&lt;span></code> to look like a link, it doesn’t have any of the free UX that comes with a real link. It does nothing at all.</p>

<h2>This next section needs a title</h2>

<p>Another paragraph. It needs some more text in order to look like a real paragraph.

<h3>An unordered list</h3>

<ul>
	<li>A point in an unordered list</li>
	<li>This font is (not) geometric</li>
	<li>This font is designed for computers, so it's probably made after 1500.</li>
</ul>
